# SkyCore — Consolidated, Runnable

This folder is the **clean, working subset** distilled from the `SkyCore_Consolidated`
archive: a real Ground Control Station web app + a live simulator backend, wired
together and verified end-to-end. For the honest inventory of the whole archive
(what's real vs. marketing), see [`AUDIT.md`](./AUDIT.md).

> **Honesty note.** A **software simulator** generates ground truth over real time.
> Five GENUINE skycore modules run in the live loop against it:
> - **navigation** — the real 22-state Adaptive UKF (`navigation/aukf.py`) filters noisy
>   GPS; the telemetry the GCS shows is the filter's estimate (`nav_backend`, live `nav_nis`).
> - **control** — the real `LQRController` (`control/lqr.py`) flies the aircraft closed-loop
>   to its targets (`control_backend`).
> - **detection** — the real `CUASClassifier` (`cuas/classifier.py`) classifies **three simulated
>   intruder tracks** (category + severity), each also tagged with a kinematic **behaviour**
>   (`fast_approach` / `loitering` / `restricted_zone`), streamed to `/ws/threats` and shown with a
>   BEHAVIOUR column on the Threats page (`detect_backend`).
> - **geofence** — the real `GeofenceValidator` (`navigation/geofence.py`) enforces a **circular**
>   no-fly zone (the module is circle-based, not polygon): a `goto` into the zone is rejected and
>   the aircraft auto-RTLs on breach. Drawn on the Missions map (`GET /api/geofence`, `geofence` in telemetry).
> - **planning** — the real `RRTStarPlanner` (`navigation/rrt.py`) routes a `goto` whose straight path
>   would cross the no-fly zone **around** it (waypoints fed to the LQR; drawn as a dashed path on the
>   Missions map) instead of tripping RTL. Verified: the aircraft rounds the zone with >40 m clearance.
>
> Plus **live weather** (genuinely external, not simulated): the real `openmeteo.py` client pulls the
> **actual** current conditions at the home coordinates from the free Open-Meteo API for a pre-flight
> safe-to-fly verdict, cached and shown on the Dashboard (`GET /api/weather`).
>
> Plus **flight history**: each flight (takeoff→land) is logged to a real **SQLite** store
> (`storage/flight_db.py`) with duration / max-altitude / distance / battery-used; recent flights
> appear on the Missions page (`GET /api/flights`).
>
> No physical drone and no real RF sensing are connected; every frame is tagged
> `source: "simulator"` and reports which real backend is active. Detection/alerting only —
> no jamming or countermeasure capability. To fly real hardware, point the GCS at a backend
> that speaks the same `/ws/telemetry` + `/ws/threats` contract.

## Legal boundary

Legitimate drone software only: mission/telemetry, computer-vision tracking, and
**detection/alerting** of unauthorized drones. This project does **not** contain and
will **not** add firmware hacking, jamming, Remote-ID defeat, illegal RF/range
boosting, or kinetic/EW takedown. Operate within your local aviation authority's
rules (FAA / EASA / CAAI).

```

Self-contained: the three genuine algorithms live under `backend/skycore/`, so the system needs
nothing outside `consolidated/` (works as a repo export and in Docker).

## Run it (one command — the whole system on one port)

The backend also serves the built GCS, so the entire system runs as **one process on
`http://localhost:8080`** — the UI, the telemetry/threat WebSockets, and the real
AUKF / LQR / C-UAS modules, together.

```powershell
cd consolidated
./launch.ps1            # Windows;   macOS / Linux / Git Bash:  ./launch.sh
```

That builds the GCS (first run only), sets up the Python venv, and starts the unified
server. Open **<http://localhost:8080>**, log in with a demo account (e.g. `admin` /
`admin123`), and use the Dashboard / Missions **Arm → Takeoff → click-map goto → Land / RTH**
controls: the status flips to **🟢 מחובר (connected)** and altitude / battery / threats
update live from the real modules.

### Run the parts separately (dev)

```powershell
# Backend only — APIs + WS on :8080 (visit / for a hint if the UI isn't built)
cd consolidated/backend
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt; venv\Scripts\python serve.py

# GCS dev server (hot reload) on :4173, talking to the backend on :8080
cd consolidated/gcs-web; npm install; npm run dev
```

## Tests

The backend has a test suite that proves the three real modules actually run in the loop
(AUKF loads and tracks, LQR flies to a waypoint, the classifier emits a valid threat, the
telemetry shape matches the GCS contract):

```powershell
cd consolidated/backend
venv\Scripts\python test_backend.py     # standalone; or: venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
```

Expected: `11/11 passed` (nav / control / detection / geofence / planning / weather / flight-history + shape checks).

There's also an **end-to-end smoke test** that drives one full mission against a running server
(arm → takeoff → goto across the no-fly zone → RRT* route around → land) and checks every subsystem
together (backends, live weather, classified threats, route/clearance, flight log):

```powershell
# with the server running (e.g. after ./launch.ps1):
cd consolidated/backend
venv\Scripts\python smoke_test.py     # exits 0 on PASS  (needs: pip install websockets)
```

## Docker (one container)

```powershell
cd consolidated
docker compose up --build      # -> http://localhost:8080
```

A multi-stage build compiles the GCS (node) and runs the unified Python server (which serves
the UI + WebSockets + the vendored real modules). Everything is in `consolidated/`, so the
container is self-contained. _(Not built in this environment — Docker wasn't installed here — but
the layout is verified working outside Docker.)_

## Authentication & config

The backend requires a **signed token** on every data API and WebSocket (verified
server-side; the client ships no credential map). Log in via the GCS with a demo
account (e.g. `admin` / `admin123`) — the server issues the token. Key env vars:

| var | default | meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `SKYCORE_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | bind address — **loopback by default**; set `0.0.0.0` to expose |
| `SKYCORE_PORT` | `8080` | port |
| `SKYCORE_AUTH` | `on` | set `off` to disable auth (local dev only) |
| `SKYCORE_JWT_SECRET` | *(ephemeral)* | signing secret — **set a stable value** for any real deployment |
| `SKYCORE_USERS` | demo users | JSON `{"user":{"password":"..","role":".."}}` to replace the demo accounts |
| `SKYCORE_CORS_ORIGINS` | dev localhost | comma-separated allowed origins |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | enables the AI Chat page (see below) |

## Optional — AI Chat page

The AI Chat page proxies through the backend (`POST /api/chat`) so the OpenRouter
key stays **server-side** and never reaches the browser. Set it in the server's
environment to enable full AI; otherwise the page answers from live telemetry offline.

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

## Fixes applied during consolidation

- **Web app didn't build at all** — added the missing `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`,
  and `tsconfig.node.json` (Vite has no entry point without them).
- **`OpenRouterService` used `process.env`**, which is undefined in a Vite browser
  build — changed to `import.meta.env.VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and added `vite-env.d.ts`.
- **Backend telemetry was static and shape-incompatible** with the GCS — replaced with
  `serve.py`, which evolves state over real time and emits the exact shape the GCS's
  `TelemetryService` reads (`battery.percent`, `position.{lat,lon,altitude}`,
  `velocity.speed`, `attitude.yaw`, `mode`) and handles `arm/disarm/takeoff/land/rtl/goto`.
- **Wired three real skycore algorithms into the live loop** — `serve.py` imports the genuine
  `navigation/aukf.py` (22-state AUKF, noisy GPS in a local-ENU-metre frame — the filter does
  `pos += vel·dt`, so lat/lon degrees would blow it up), `control/lqr.py` (`LQRController` flies
  the point-mass closed-loop, with a drone-like velocity envelope), and `cuas/classifier.py`
  (`CUASClassifier` grades a simulated intruder → `/ws/threats`). Verified: AUKF ~0.4 m error,
  LQR converges to waypoints at ~16 m/s, classifier escalates the intruder high→critical as it
  closes. Each has an honest fallback (raw truth / naive mover / no threats) if its module errors.
- **Built the Threats page + wired `AdsBService`** to consume `/ws/threats`, so the real
  classifier's verdict (e.g. `commercial_drone / critical`) renders live in the GCS.

## Known gaps / honest limitations

- `gcs-web` had strict unused-import checks (`noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters`)
  temporarily relaxed to get a green build; there are unused imports to clean up.
- Real **AUKF navigation**, **LQR control**, and **CUASClassifier detection** are wired into the
  live loop, and **all six GCS pages are real and backend-driven**:
  - **Dashboard** — a live tactical map (own drone from the AUKF estimate, the classified threats
    colour-coded by severity with behaviour labels, the no-fly zone, the planned route) + telemetry
    cards + a real event log derived from live state changes (mode / threat / geofence).
  - **Threats** — the real classifier feed (`/ws/threats`).
  - **Telemetry** — live SVG charts (altitude/speed/battery) + AUKF/LQR/detect provenance + NIS.
  - **Missions** — SVG tactical map; click the map to `goto` (flies the real LQR); arm/takeoff/land/RTL.
  - **AI Chat** — proxies through the backend (`POST /api/chat`) to OpenRouter when the server has
    `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (key stays server-side); otherwise an honest offline assistant that answers
    from live telemetry (`status`, `battery`, `threats`, …).
  - **Video** — honest: **no fake camera**. Shows a clear "NO LIVE CAMERA FEED" banner + a live
    telemetry **instrument HUD** (labeled NOT camera). Real feed needs DJI/PX4 RTSP hardware.
- `TelemetryService.sendCommand` now **queues** commands until the WebSocket opens (the first press
  after a page load is no longer dropped).
